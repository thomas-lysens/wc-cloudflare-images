# WooCommerce Cloudflare Images

The WooCommerce Cloudflare Images plug-in is made in order to use the Cloudflare Images CDN with ease. By default WooCommerce (neither WordPress actually) to easily use a CDN for your product images instead of using the images uploaded to your webserver.

If you have a big eCommerce website, with a lot of products and each of them having multiple images to display the product, it can slow down your website disastrously. That is where CDNs come in handy.
